# Googol
A game that teaches when to quit

# How to Play
Starting from the first button (inorder), you try to find the highest hidden number.
The maximum hidden number can range from 1000 to 10000.
So when you find a number that you think is the greatest, you click finished.
If you pass a number you cannot revert to it as the greatest number. (No when to quit)
Hit refresh to play again.
